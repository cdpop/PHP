<?php
/*
We declare the form
Specify an action and method
Action is where the form gets submitted so we will include a submit button
I want the action to link back to this same page
Method can be get or post
GET is sending the data through the URL
POST sends it through the HTTP post method
Naming is like naming a varible
After index.php we have a question mark saying we have a day and date and year
and that shows them their values
